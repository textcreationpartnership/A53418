            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96536:14"/> their place, who with their Clerks do give daily attendance at the Rolls, as well in the Vacation as Term-time, for the more ſpeedy diſpatch of ſuch Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes as are to be examined in or near <hi>London,</hi> upon Cauſes depending in <hi>Chancery;</hi> and for the parties to decline the ſworn Officers of the Court, conſtituted for that purpoſe, without any juſt exception againſt them, giveth cauſe to ſuſpect the ſame to be done for ſiniſter purpoſes (Examinations taken in Court being always eſteemed better and more indifferent there taken, than by Commiſſion.)

His Honour taking conſideration thereof, and for redreſs for the future doth order and command all the Clerks in the ſaid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Offices, that they forthwith turn over all Bills, Anſwers and Pleadings which they have in their ſeveral cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodies, or have delivered out to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96536:41"/> and which ought to have been turned over and filed before this time, to the end they may be all forthwith filed with the ſeveral Six Clerks for their ſafe cuſtody. And that all the Clerks hereafter be more careful for the filing all Bills, Anſwers and other Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in due time, and that no Clerk hereafter preſume upon any pretences whatſoever, to Copy any Bill, Anſwer, or other Pleadings before they be duly filed;<note place="margin">

                        </note> and that the Client who delivers any Bill, Anſwer, or other Pleading to be ſo copied before the filing thereof, ſhall be adjudged equally faulty, as the other Clerk that ſhall ſo copy them. And that no Clerk ſhall deliver any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to be carried forth of the Offices to be copied. And it is further order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That if hereafter any diſobedience by any of the Under-Clerks in that Office ſhall appear; it is thereby order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the Six Clerks in whoſe Office the default ſhall be found, ſhall forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with preſent ſuch default to the ſaid Maſter; and if the ſame be found true, ſuch Clerk or Clerks are hereby diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſit any more in that Office, as an Under-Clerk, or keep any Desk there, and ſhall pay the full Damage and Coſts that the party grieved, whom it may concern, ſhall be at by ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96536:42"/> And it is further ordered, That this Order be fixed up forthwith in the Office of the Six Clerks, that every one may take notice thereof.

                     <head>An Order of the Court, made for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the abuſes ariſing from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Copies of Depoſitions, by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies taken from the Examiner.</head>
                     <p>FOraſmuch as Complaints have been often made by the Examiners, and ſeveral Suitors of this Court, of the great injury and prejudice that hath been done to them by Under-Clerks and Sollicitors, making and writing out Copies from Copies of Depoſitions delivered by the Examiner out of his Office, and ſelling the ſame to the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Upon ſtrict inquiry into, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the aforeſaid complaint, it hath appeared to the Right Honourable the Maſter of the Rolls, as well by Certificates of the Maſters of this Court to whom ſome of the ſaid abuſes have been referred; as alſo by other good proof, that after Copies of the Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been taken from the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the ſame Copies have been alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in divers places, and material parts
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96536:45"/> of ſome Depoſitions quite ſtruck out by the party himſelf or his Agent, who took the ſame from the Examiner, and afterwards Copies thereof have been made and given, or ſold to the adverſe party himſelf at mean rates, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to his Clerk or Solicitor, who hath delivered them to his Client, and taken the Examiners full Fees for them; and ſometimes the Clerk or Solicitor, when he hath had the Copies of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions given to him by his Client to breviate or keep for him, hath private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written Copies thereof, and hath extended the ſame to an unreaſonable number of ſheets more than thoſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Examiners Office, and then by combination with the Clerk or Solicitor for the other Side, without the knowledge of the Client who took out the ſaid Copies, or the Examiners, have delivered the ſaid waſtfully written Copies to the adverſe party, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame are true Copies taken out of the Examiners Office; and have demanded and received of the Client the Examiners Fees for the ſame, and ſhared the monies amongſt themſelves; and do alſo uſe divers abuſes and practices of like nature, whereby Clients have been ruined in their Cauſes, the Court wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Judgment, and the Examiner
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96536:45"/> couſened of his due Fees, who hath not only the fruits of his own labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly ſwallowed up by Clerks and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitors for want of the delivery of ſuch ſecond Copies, but doth alſo incur ſcandalous imputations, by reaſon ſuch ſurreptitious Copies are many times faſly made, out of deſign to ruin the adverſe party, and are generally ill and looſly written, being ſuppoſed by the party, who paid for them, and by all others who take notice thereof, to be taken out of the Examiners Office; ſome of which ſaid abuſes and foul pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices have been formerly taken notice of, and much endeavoured to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and ſuppreſſed by this Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Court, by impriſoning the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and other ways, as by an Order of this Court, dated the 8th of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1 <hi>Car.</hi> and another made between <hi>Lockſmith</hi> Plaintiff againſt <hi>Creſwell</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, dated the 16th of <hi>May</hi> 10 <hi>Car.</hi> another between <hi>Allington</hi> Plaintiff, againſt <hi>Dandy</hi> Defendant, dated the 5th of <hi>July,</hi> 13 <hi>Car.</hi> and divers other Orders appeareth. Therefore the Right Honourable the Maſter of the Rolls ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Premiſſes into his conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth think fit and order, That if at any time hereafter it ſhall probably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the ſaid Examiners, or either of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96536:46"/> them,<note place="margin">The Examiner may take out Subpaena's againſt ſuch as ſhall be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deliver undue Copies of Depoſitions to the adverſe Party or Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations of ſuch Offenders upon Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and againſt ſuch perſons as he conceives are able to prove ſuch abuſe.</note> before or after the hearing of any Cauſe, that any ſuch ſurreptitious Copy ſhall be made as aforeſaid, the Examiner who findeth himſelf aggrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, may, if he will, take out Subpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's againſt any two, three or more ſuch perſons as he ſhall ſuſpect to have a hand therein, for examination of ſuch miſdores upon Interrogatories in that behalf to be exhibited before the other Examiner, and firſt allowed of by a Maſter of this Court touching the point of Fraud and Abuſes before mentioned; as alſo againſt ſuch perſons whom he conceives to be able to prove the ſaid Abuſe in caſe it be denied; and if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſideration had of the Anſwers of the ſaid parties ſuſpected to the ſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories or proofs,<note place="margin">Vide ſupra An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Regni Car. <hi>1.</hi> primo.</note> it ſhall appear unto the ſaid Maſter of this Court who allowed of the Articles, and be by him certified, that the ſaid parties are faulty in all or any of the Abuſes before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, or any of like nature, that then every perſon ſo offending, ſhall for ſuch his miſdemeanor be committed to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Fleet, from whence he ſhall not be diſcharged till he hath given ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Examiner touching the ſame, provided that if the parties drawn in queſtion ſhall acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon their Examination, and the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96536:46"/> Examiner not be able to prove the ſame, that then the Examiner who called them in by Proceſs, ſhall pay coſts for unjuſt examination, as the Court ſhall think fit.</p>

But upon hearing the Six Clerks he had no relief, but the Six Clerks
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96536:59"/> and their Predeceſſors enjoyed their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rights therein; and in the 11th year of the ſaid late King, the Lord <hi>Coventry</hi> (upon careful examination thereof, with the concurrent opinion of the then Maſter of the Rolls, and Sir <hi>John Banks</hi> then Attorney Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral) did, amongſt other of the Six Clerks Rights, certifie the ſaid late King, under his Hand, that it was the Right of the Six Clerks to inroll all Warrants for Parents whatſoever; and that it was the right of the Clerk of Inrolments to inroll all Recognizances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Cloſe Rolls, which were made from Subject to Subject, or from the Subject to the King, for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects benefit, for the accuſtomed Fee, and (if the Attorney General, or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor require it) to inroll any Deed or Writing, made to his Majeſty, for his own uſe, without Fee. Whereupon the ſaid late King, in the ſaid 11th year of His Reign confirmed the ſaid Rights (amongſt others) to the Six Clerks, and the Clerk of the Inrolments, with an Inhibition to all others to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with their ſaid Rights. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs Mr. <hi>Kipps</hi> (upon a claim by Mr. <hi>Hains,</hi> by colour of the like Grant to him, as formerly to <hi>Baſeley</hi>) refuſeth to deliver ſuch Warrants of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96536:59"/> Leaſes, that lately paſſed the Great Seal, to them, to be inrolled. And therefore they humbly prayed his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to order Mr. <hi>Kipps</hi> to deliver the ſaid Warrants to the riding Clerk to be inrolled, according to their Juſt Right. Whereupon his Lordſhip de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the Maſter of the Rolls to call all parties concerned, before him (having heard their ſeveral Allegations) to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his Lordſhip how he found the caſe between them: who having according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard them, made his Report or Certificate to his Lordſhip in theſe words, 9 <hi>July</hi> 1662. To the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> Lord High Chancellor of <hi>England:</hi> According to your Lordſhips directions the 29th of <hi>April,</hi> 1662. Upon the Six Clerks Petition to have the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants of Leaſes delivered unto them by Mr. <hi>Kipps,</hi> to be inrolled, I have heard them; and <hi>Hains,</hi> with his Councel, who made it appear, that there had been ſeveral Patents of like nature to his, granted to ſeveral perſons ſince the 26th of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. In Anſwer whereunto the ſix Clerks ſay, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſaid Patents, Mr. <hi>Hains</hi> doth not ſhew that ever any of the ſaid Patentees did inroll any War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants for Grants, that paſs the Great
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96536:60"/> Seal; nor do any words, as I conceive in his, or any former Patents mentioned by him, extend to the inrolment of any ſuch Warrants. The Six Clerks fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made it appear, that <hi>Edward Baſely,</hi> the late Patentee, petitioned the lat King againſt them in 1634. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the inrollments of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Deeds, which was referred to the Commiſſioners of exacted Fees; and I find in the year following, upon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination had by the Lord Keeper, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry,</hi> with the concurrent Opinion of Sir <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> Maſter of the Rolls, and Sir <hi>John Banks,</hi> Attorney General, it was certified under the hand of the ſaid Lord Keeper, amongſt other things, to have been the due ancient Right, held and enjoyed by the Six Clerks, to inroll all manner of Warrants for Patent Leaſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby the ſaid Patent Leaſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> paſs the Great Seal;<note place="margin">Six Clerks to inroll all War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants for Patent Leaſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Leaſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> paſs the Great Seal.</note> whereupon his late Majeſty, by his Letters Patents, bearing date the 17th of <hi>June</hi> 1635. to take away all queſtions, doubts and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguities that heretofore have been, or hereafter may be raiſed concerning the ſame; and to the end the Six Clerks, and their Succeſſors for ever after, might inviolably hold the ſame, did allow, approve, grant, ratifie and confirm the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96536:60"/> ſame. And it was therein declared to be His Majeſty's pleaſure, that the ſaid Warrants ſhall be delivered from time to time by him or them, in whoſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody they ſhall remain, to the Six Clerk, who ſhall be riding Clerk for the time being, to the end the ſaid Warrants might be inrolled: His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, further, by the ſaid Patent, ſtraightly charging and commanding, that no other perſon or perſons whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhould from thenceforth encroach or uſurp upon them therein, or moleſt or diſturb them touching the ſame. And the Six Clerks accordingly have ever ſince inrolled the ſaid Warrants; and before, and ever ſince have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Fees due for the ſame. All which I humbly ſubmit to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips grave conſideration; as by the ſaid Report, remaining filed with the Regiſter of this Court appeareth.</p>

And his Lordſhip being informed, that ſeveral Recognizances, as well as this, have in ancient times, as well as lately, have been inrolled, though long after the time, by Warrant from the Maſter of the Rolls for the time being, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to all Purchaſors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the time ſuch Recognizance ought to be inrolled, and the time of the actual inrolment thereof. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Lordſhip taking into conſideration the evil and dangerous conſequences that may happen and ariſe to the Subject, by ſuffering Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zances to be inrolled long after the time of acknowledgment thereof.

                     <p>WHereas in former times, as well as lately, Complaints have been made by the Examiners of this Court, That after Depoſitions of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes have been taken in their Office between parties, Plaintiff and Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, one of the ſaid Parties, or ſome of their Agents, have taken out the Copies of Depoſitions for his Party only; and afterwards the ſame Party hath for Mony or other reward, given or ſuffered other Copies to be made out of them, to the adverſe Party, his Solicitor or Agent, who have made uſe of them on all occaſions, as if authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick: By reaſon of which ſaid ſecond Copies, ſo ſurreptitiouſly made, the Court may be miſguided; all which doings tend to the great abuſe of the Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and prejudice of the Clients and their Cauſes, as well as to the ſcandal of the ſaid Office, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving the Officers of their due Fees.

And whereas the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Examiners of this Court have by their humble Petition beſought the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> for redreſs in the Premiſſes, and to prevent the like inconveniences for the future, and his Lordſhip ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken their ſaid Petition into his ſerious conſideration, and calling to mind, that the like matter thereby complained of, happned lately in Court in the Cauſes of <hi>Wilcox</hi> and <hi>Doughty,</hi> and <hi>Doughty</hi> and <hi>Wilcox,</hi> and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the laſt Order made in ſuch Caſes, that the Cauſes ſhould be put off, and five Pounds paid to the other ſide is no redreſs to the Court, (who is the Party grieved, he being put to the new charge of another days at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, and the five Pounds being never paid) foraſmuch as the Clerks and Agents on both Sides are Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates in the ſaid practice; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
